The Electronic voting machine (EVM) may be a basic computer utilized in the fashionable
electoral system to record votes. The foundation of democracy is the fundamental right to
vote. To overcome certain disadvantages in the previously existing voting system, a new
variation of already existing technology, the Intelligent Electronic Voting Machine (IEVM) is
introduced. The process of verification of the voter, casting vote, and result analysis all
these features are condensed into a single device called the electronic voting machine.
In this device, first, the verification of the voter through facial recognition is done then,
if verified, the voting process is resumed. The list of participating parties with
their name and a unique code is displayed. Voters cast their votes through their voices or
by just a click of a button. It is an automated device whose purpose is to provide a
secure and reliable environment to the voters in electing the candidates. As the device is
automated, results can be obtained quickly.
